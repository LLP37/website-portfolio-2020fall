  <h1>What Rules Do Computers Force On Us?</h1>
  <p> When thinking about computers and the rules that they “force” me to follow one thing that comes to mind is where I store things. Computers only have but so much storage space, so I can’t just continuously store things in the same place. For example, I am the type of person who always stores things in the Desktop area (so that it’s easy to find later) unless the computer forces me to choose an alternative location. When I use up the space on my Desktop, I utilize the OneDrive system that we have through Pitt and store older papers in there such as papers for classes that I took the semester before. This will then allow me more space on my Desktop to store new assignments. In addition, I think the battery life of a computer is limiting for users as I always keep my charger at my desk (where my power strip is) so that kind of limits me in terms of where I can be in my room when my laptop needs to charge. I know that most people would say you can just move to another outlet, but there are no other convenient ones in my room and I don’t like to unplug the cord as I know that I will probably just drop it on the desk and forget to plug it back in for when I need it next).

                  I can obviously break my charger rule when I need to go somewhere else for an extended period of time by unplugging the charger and taking it with me. In addition, as I stated above I can utilize online storage systems like Google Drive and OneDrive to store materials that I don’t use anymore so I have more space to store things on my Desktop, thus I found a way around the “storage limit rule”.

                  Some other obligations of the computer include allowing us to connect in a quicker, easier fashion. People can text and email people from around the globe and have them receive it almost instantaneously. Computers also allow us access to the internet which allows for an unlimited amount of knowledge to be at our fingertips every second of the day. An ambiguous obligation of computers is through the use of a user interface, which allows users to have a much cleaner look at an app and provided them with easier use. If they saw all the code that went into making it, they would find the tool to be much harder to use.

                  In addition, when looking at “who blinks first”, I would have to say humans as humans are the ones coding machines. If humans make an error in the code, then the machine won’t run or won’t work right. Therefore, the behavior the machine is dependent on humans. Though as AI comes into play machines are becoming more intelligent and are able to “blink first” more often, but humans still have the upper hand. I do think that while machines are dependent on humans, humans are letting machines change their behavior. For example, humans have become very dependent on their phones for doing even the simplest of tasks. Instead of walking next door to ask your neighbor a question, you will probably just text them even though they are probably only 100 ft (or less) away! A lot of us probably don’t even know all of our neighbors’ names, so machines changing our behavior.</p>
