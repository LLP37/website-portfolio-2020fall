      <p>When thinking about computers and the rules that they “force” me to </br>
         follow one thing that comes to mind is where I store things. Computers </br>
         only have but so much storage space, so I can’t just continuously store </br>
          things in the same place. For example, I am the type of person who </br>
          always stores things in the Desktop area (so that it’s easy to find </br>
          later) unless the computer forces me to choose an alternative location.</br>
           When I use up the space on my Desktop, I utilize the OneDrive system </br>
           that we have through Pitt and store older papers in there such as papers </br>
            for classes that I took the semester before. This will then allow me </br>
             more space on my Desktop to store new assignments. CLICK IMAGE FOR MORE</p>

      <h2>What Excites Me Most About Technology?</h2>

      <p>What excites me most about computers and computations is all the possibilities </br>
        and the convenience of it. I think it is so much easier to type things out then to </br>
        have to write everything out as you don’t always have a piece of paper and a pen with you.</br>
         In addition, devices such as phones allow you to do a multitude of tasks rather than </br>
         needing a variety of devices. For example, instead of needing a paper and pen to write </br>
         as well as a calculator to do calculations instead you could just carry around your phone </br>
         which has a calculator and notes app. Therefore, the convenience of having a device that</br>
          makes your life so much simpler is exciting. CLICK IMAGE FOR MORE </p>
