    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>For the Blog, I plan on structuring a couple different "blog posts" <br/>
       how you see them on most blogs, where you can maybe see the beginning of <br/>
        the post, but not much else after that (you click on the portion of the post <br/>
        to be taken to full post (that may have to be an aspirational goal).</p>
