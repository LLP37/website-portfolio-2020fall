For this preview, the main portion to look at is the homepage of my website which is fairly basic. I based it a lot on what we learned in the tutorials and it looks pretty close to how I would like, but I think I might add more pictures or something next to the picture of myself as I think that it looks very empty right now. I also want to put a different picture of myself as I want something more professional looking, but none of the pictures on my phone quite matched what I was looking for so I went with this one for now. In addition, the current navigation menu is featured below my title, but ideally I would like those like to be featured on either side of my title (two on the left, two on the right), but I was spending so much time figuring out how to do that, that I decided I needed to move on so that I could do a little bit of CSS for the preview, so people could see what color palette I am thinking of, I really like the light pink I have now. In addition, I didn't have enough time to add content to each of my tabs, but I did add in a general description to showcase what I plan to do on that tab. I think the titles of the tab are pretty self-explanatory in what I plan on doing on that page though and I know a lot of people are doing similar things for their projects. For the Blog, I plan on structuring a couple different "blog posts" how you see them on most blogs, where you can maybe see the beginning of the post, but not much else after that (you click on the portion of the post to be taken to full post (that may have to be an aspirational goal). For Projects, I plan to add some of my CS projects as well as the Visual Argument and Audacity projects from this class. Meanwhile, the Contact page will have ways that they can get in touch with me (LinkedIn, gmail, Github). Overall, I think the thing that caused me the most trouble was the navigation bar, so if anyone has any good tutorials for getting it how I described that would be helpful.
