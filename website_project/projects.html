      <h2> ENGCMP 0610 Soundscape Project </h2>
      <p> I titled my Soundscape project Virtually Alone and you will be able </br>
        to hear what a day in the life of a college student is like during the </br>
        COVID-19 pandemic while at school. It can be really hard when you don't </br>
        have many places to go and are only able to see a select number of people </br>
        Therefore, my title is Virtually Alone because a lot of people can feel </br>
        lonely right now even if they are technically "seeing" a lot of people </br>
        virtually over Zoom </p>

   <h2> ENGCMP 0610 Visual Argument Project </h2>
     <p> For my visual argument "Women in Computing, Now That's IT..." </br>
     (get it IT = Information Technology), I wanted to focus on the fact </br>
      that we need more women in the tech industry. As a Women in Computer </br>
      Science (tech field), this is a topic that I hear people talk about a </br>
      lot and I definitely notice that women are lacking in numbers in the </br>
      field. In one of my CS classes in high school, I was 1 of 4 girls in a </br>
       25 person class. Therefore, it's something that I have noticed quite a </br>
        bit, so I thought my visual argument would be a great place to call for </br>
        more women in the tech field.
