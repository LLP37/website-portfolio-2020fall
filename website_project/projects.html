      <h2> ENGCMP 0610 Soundscape Project </h2>
      <p> I titled my Soundscape project Virtually Alone and you will be able
        to hear what a day in the life of a college student is like during the
        COVID-19 pandemic while at school. It can be really hard when you don't
        have many places to go and are only able to see a select number of people
        Therefore, my title is Virtually Alone because a lot of people can feel
        lonely right now even if they are technically "seeing" a lot of people
        virtually over Zoom </p>

   <h2> ENGCMP 0610 Visual Argument Project </h2>
     <p> For my visual argument "Women in Computing, Now That's IT..."
     (get it IT = Information Technology), I wanted to focus on the fact
      that we need more women in the tech industry. As a Women in Computer
      Science (tech field), this is a topic that I hear people talk about a
      lot and I definitely notice that women are lacking in numbers in the
      field. In one of my CS classes in high school, I was 1 of 4 girls in a
       25 person class. Therefore, it's something that I have noticed quite a
        bit, so I thought my visual argument would be a great place to call for
        more women in the tech field.

    <h2> ENGCMP 0610 Website Logo </h2>
      <p> For this website project, I utilized Canva and Gimp to finish my simpler
        logo. I wanted it to be clean and simple to not take away from things
        other parts of my website. I also wanted it to be clean and simple, since
        I think that is my website aesthetic (simple colors, simple fonts, etc.). In
        addition, one of my main motivations for adding this here was to make my
        grid layout look more balanced, the grid layout was an aspirational criteria
        for this website project.
