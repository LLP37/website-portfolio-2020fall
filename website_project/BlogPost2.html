  <h1>What Excites Me Most About Technology?</h1>
  <p> What excites me most about computers and computations is all the possibilities and the convenience of it. I think it is so much easier to type things out then to have to write everything out as you don’t always have a piece of paper and a pen with you. In addition, devices such as phones allow you to do a multitude of tasks rather than needing a variety of devices. For example, instead of needing a paper and pen to write as well as a calculator to do calculations instead you could just carry around your phone which has a calculator and notes app. Therefore, the convenience of having a device that makes your life so much simpler is exciting. Also, computational devices are always evolving through creating new technology or bettering older technology. For example, every year or two years there is a new iPhone with better technology than the previous version. A couple years from now maybe see virtual reality be a standard part of the iPhone! The possibilities for improvement are endless, which is probably the most exciting thing about computation and computer to me. With being a Computer Science major, I find the idea of endless possibilities especially exciting because it means that there will be a lot of interesting developments that I may be a part of in the future!

Meanwhile, what makes me most fearful about technology is probably how much time we spend on it especially the younger generations. Personally, I think I use technology way too much in my free time by going on Netflix and listening to music. Therefore, I am fearful that I will continue this bad habit and that we will only see it get worse as technology gets more advanced and is capable of doing more. For example, now that dating apps exist people’s first interaction is virtual and not face-to-face like it used to be (this example doesn't really apply in COVID times). While dating apps aren’t always a bad thing, it is limiting that initial social interaction. This face-to-face limitation is something that I think will become more common as technology becomes more prevalent which I believe is both scary/sad, therefore that is what I fear the most.</p>
