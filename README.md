# Project 3: Website Portfolio

Note: All of my website project html/css/image files can be found in the website_project folder, my screenshots are in the Screenshot folder, and my Credits.md file is listed next to this ReadMe.md file.

For my website project, I decided to do a portfolio style website with a little twist since I added in the blog section. My website includes a Home page, Project Page (where you can see some of my projects from this class as well as hear about the logo for this project), Contact Page, Blog Page (with two blog posts), and a Credits page (linked at bottom of main 4 pages that takes you to a couple screenshots of my sources). Prior to this project, I had no experience with CSS and barely any experience with HTML, so I am very happy with how my project turned out! Please refer to my reflection for a more detailed description of my project.
